# Telco-Site-Initial-Dashboard
The project created for the academy capstone project. Looking for adding visual dashboard for telco site capacity monitoring, as well as the simple initial predicting model to justify the expansion plan based on the demography reference. 
The dataset refer to one of the Telco operator in Indonesia, for specific area in Sulawesi &amp; North Maluku in week24 2016. Additional demography dataset refer to BPS (Badan Pusat Statistik).
The program using R language.

Classification model with random forest (ranger) and gbm using to predict if the new sites will be "Justified" or "notJustified". Label on dataset is custom created, here the threshold refer to value of q3 of Payload distribution value of overall sites.

The initial prediction model still need to be improved. The final apps using shinyapps can be seen in https://kangdata.shinyapps.io/TelecomDashboard/.


Cheers
